# simplycompass
A minecraft mod around the compass.

First and foremost, fixes [the vanilla wobble bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-83905) like suggested in the bug report.  
As for the rest:
* Currently makes the vanilla compass point to the North;
* Adds an iron coil, that can be redstone powered;
* Adds a Resonant Compass, that can be set to point to a coil block, working only when set to a powered coil.

This project is currently a work in progress.
